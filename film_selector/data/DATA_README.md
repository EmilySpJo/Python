# Data folder
<p>This folder contains the data sets pertaining to the content available on Amazon Prime and Netflix, the Jupyter notebooks used to carry out data handling as well as the modified CSV's created by the contents of the Jupyter notebooks.</p>
<p>I chose to use a Jupyter notebook here instead of a standard python script as it allowed me to easily see the alterations I had made to the data sets, data set structure, etc without having to frequently interact with a terminal, etc.</p>
