Deidra Muro, whose melodious vocals compliment musical cohort Paul Hammer's boy next door pairing at the helm of indie pop outfit Savoir Adore, does an impression...of Ben Gibbard...singing ""Take Me Out To The Ballgame"". She of course did not volunteer such an impression, but was egged on to do so by one of her band mates. And, it wasn't too bad. In this performance at Brooklyn Bowl, the promising New York upstarts reveal an affection for bands like Death Cab For Cutie that might go a little deeper than cute impressions. Here, the band twist lovelorn lyrics and head clenching instrumental/vocal melodies, providing the kind of affecting twine that may as well replace the heart strings for tugging on. Plus, the band's crisp and tidy pop tunes suggest they place a premium on their craft. In short, Savoir Adore are a band to keep an eye on. Perhaps you should start with this set captured during last summer's edition of The Northside Festival."

Movie,Brahms,2006,30 min,Music Videos and Concerts,"Our latest concert video comes with a hazy, night vision glow to it. It would seem electro-rock outfit BRAHMS love performing under a cover of darkness...and with good reason. Theirs' is an inebriated sort of sound packaged in nocturnal beats, glassy waves of synths, and unrestrained sing along choruses. It's the kind of sound that makes me suspect that even their 11:30 headlining set at The Northside Festival was a bit too early for their tastes. Nevertheless, the art school electronics the Brooklyn based band filled the cavernous Brooklyn Bowl with drove the mass who had gathered before them mad...a delirious mess of flailing arms, bopping heads, and whatever else was going on in the darkness. Though they might have closed Cantora Bowl with this performance, my guess is BRAHMS only got the evening kicking for the slew who danced their way through this performance. - David Pitz"
