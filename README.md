This directory contains varying projects I have completed in python
## Project outline
| Folder | Outline of contents |
|--------|---------------------|
|[film_selector](./film_selector/)| This personal project uses big data sets from both Netflix and Amazon, containing the TV shows and films that they offer to give a user suggestions on content they could watch based on their desired platform, media type and genre as obtained through their interaction with a dedicated GUI. |
|[FTP_Project](./FTP_Project/)| This is a project I completed as part of a team of 4 during an internship between years 1 and 2 of my undergraduate Computer Science degree. We produced a system that downloads requested csv files containing medical research data from an external FTP server, validates the format and contents of the files and stores them in a calendar-based directory system.|
